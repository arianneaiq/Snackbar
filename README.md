## Usage

### Case description 

You are asked to develop some software for the snackbar “MacSnack”. The application should be able to 
display information about snacks and show their sales-price. A client can order some snacks. 
We are going to use the class Snack. 

### Additional features 
* Firstly, to prevent there are not enough snacks in the snackbar, your app should inform the snackbar-
owner if the number in stock of a snack becomes below a certain limit, so the snackbar-owner can add 
some snacks to the snackbar. For each snack, this limit could be different (In the Netherlands we eat more 
hamburgers than cheese sticks). Add such a limit to the class Snack. Maybe you have to modify your 
constructor, otherwise it will be very hard to have the limit set. 

* Secondly, add the functionality to change the price of a snack. For instance, have 3 radiobuttons to 
indicate for which snack the price should change.
